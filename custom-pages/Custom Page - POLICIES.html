<h2>RETURNS:</h2>
<p>
	 <font size="3"> All sales are final for digital products. Due to the made-to-order nature of our apparel, orders are non-refundable. Items are not returnable due to sizing issues. Since all garments are made-to-order, we cannot replace/remake a garment that was not ordered in the correct size. Please choose the correct size by referring to our size charts and product descriptions. If there has been an error within your order we will be happy to work with you to rectify the situation. We can only cancel orders up to 1 hour after the order has been placed as work on your order begins almost immediately.</font>
</p>
<h2>SHIPPING:</h2>

	 <font size="3">Our business days are Monday to Friday and we are closed on weekends and holidays. All production and shipping times are in business days and do not include days that we are closed.<br />
